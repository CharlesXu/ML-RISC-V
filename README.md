# ML-RISC-V

This project is a simple neural network written in Assembly code that interprets the value of hand-written numbers. 

# Project Structure

This code works by looking at a pixel array of a hand written number, converting that to a binary representation, then letting the assembly code do its work. 

The handwritten values
